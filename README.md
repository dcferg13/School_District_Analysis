## Summary
Four changes that are in the updated school district analysis after the ninth grade reading and math scores are were the scores based on school type, scores by school size, the district summary, and the school summary. However all these changes were very minimal, most likely because it was a small group of student scores that had to be replaced. Although, when there is evidence of academic dishonesty in one grade of a high school there is mostly likely more happening with the school. However, without evidence we cannot adjust the school district analysis.
